# ¿Cómo elegir la herramienta de monitorización de Kubernetes adecuada?

Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating containerized applications' deployment, scaling, and management. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes helps to provide high availability and scalability to applications running on it.

Monitoring Kubernetes is critical to ensure that applications run efficiently and as expected. Monitoring needs to track the performance of resources, nodes, and services in the cluster, as well as collect log data from the applications running on it. This data can be used to detect and diagnose issues, as well as to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, monitoring needs to be able to alert administrators if there are any problems or anomalies.

Benefits of using Kubernetes monitoring tools

Improved Efficiency: Kubernetes monitoring tools help to identify application performance issues quickly and efficiently. This helps to determine the root cause of problems and speeds up the process of finding a resolution.
