## Who.. who wh... who the hell is this guy? 💀 

Hi! My name is Nicolás Georger, and I consider myself a professional _**ñoño**_ (nerd, geek in chilean slang), specialized in roles within Platfom/SRE and DevOps culture.

Recently I was a part of [@Cencosud-X](https://github.com/Cencosud-X), as SRE of the Platform Team. I have more than 4 years of experience as **the devops guy**  and many more years as freelance multipurpose sysadmin/fullstack developer. _in the beggining of time, when a species called "webmasters"_ lived on Earth,  I was among them.

## Projects

**SREDevOps.dev**, where we seek promotion and support to the SRE/DevOps culture in Chile and Latin America, through communities, platforms, activities involving shared knowledge, tools, technologies, practices and labs. [@sredevopsdev](https://github.com/sredevopsdev)

Also I'm the founder of [ElClaustro.cl](https://elclaustro.cl) a project which promotes gothic, dark and alternative culture since 2004. Now we are also a label.
