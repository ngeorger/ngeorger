Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and DevOps practitioner with over 5 years of experience in industries such as retail, consultancy, food, and telecom. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and I am committed to free software and open source.

Linux and Kubernetes enthusiast, with a strong understanding of cloud computing and DevOps principles. I am also a cybernetic-systemic thinker, which means that I am able to see the big picture and understand how complex systems work together.

I am eager to share my experience and skills with people who are passionate about technology, innovation, and DIY ideals. I am also the founder of SREDevOps.Org, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting education and collaboration in the field of Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps.
