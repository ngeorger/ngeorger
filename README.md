## Who.. who wh... who the hell is this guy? ðŸ’€ 
I am a Linux and Kubernetes enthusiast, committed to free software and open source ecosystem. My self-taught IT skills are backed by a social sciences academic background, making me a cybernetic-systemic thinker. I am eager to share my experience and skills with people who share that passion for technology, innovation and improvement-native ideals.

As an experienced SRE/DevOps professional, I specialize in Site Reliability Engineer/DevOps culture, delivering incremental usability, stability, clearer governance, trusted observability and automated scalability. With over 5 years of experience in industries such as retail, food, and telecommunications, I have a proven track record of achieving these goals by fostering close relationships with people and teams.
