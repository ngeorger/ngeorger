Currently I'm a member of the SRE team at @[Cencosud-X](https://github.com/Cencosud-X) and starting a community to promote the DevOps and SRE culture, practices and technologie, focused into latin american contexts. @[sredevops.cl](https://github.com/sredevopscl).

I love Cybernetics as an approach to understand systems relationships and abstractons from a inter-disciplinary analysis., so I'm supporter of Free Software and Open Source, as a mean to human development, where Information Technologies plays a key role.

This is my public profile, feel free to reach me.
