## Who.. who wh... who the hell is this guy? ðŸ’€ 

Hi! My name is NicolÃ¡s Georger, and I consider myswelf a professional _**Ã±oÃ±o**_ (nerd, geek in chilean slang), specialized within Platfom Engineering/Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps culture.

Recently I was a part of [@Cencosud-X](https://github.com/Cencosud-X), as SRE of the Platform Team. I have more than 4 years of experience as **the devops guy**  and many more as a multipurpose geek. Mosly roles similar to a sysadmin. Before that, _in the beggining of time, when a species called "webmasters"_ lived on Earth,  I used to be one of them.

Besides, I'm promoting an initiative named **SREDevOps.dev**, where we seek promotion and support to the SRE/DevOps culture in Chile and Latin America, through communities, platforms, activities involving shared knowledge, tools, technologies, practices and labs.
