Currently I'm a SRE @[Cencosud-X](https://github.com/Cencosud-X) and starting a community for latin americdan promotion of the DevOps and SRE culture, practices and technologies @[sredevops.cl](https://github.com/sredevopscl).

I mostly love Cybernetics as an approach to understand systems and relationships between a multi-systemic approach, so I'm supporter of Free Software and Open Source, as a mean to human development.

This is my public profile, feel free to reach me.
