## Who.. who wh... who the hell is this guy? 💀 

Hi! My name is Nicolás Georger, and I consider myself a professional _**ñoño**_ (nerd, geek in chilean slang), mostly specialized within DevOps/SRE/Platforms culture and practices.

I have more than 4 years of experience as **the devops guy**  and many more years as freelance multipurpose sysadmin/fullstack developer. The tales of the ancients tells: **_in the beggining of time, a strange species lived on Earth, they were called called "webmasters"_**. Well, I was among them.
