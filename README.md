Hi! My name is NicolÃ¡s Georger, and I consider myswelf a professional _**Ã±oÃ±o** (nerd, geek in chilean slang)_ , specialized in roles within Platfom Engineering/Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps culture.

Recently I was a part of [@Cencosud-X](https://github.com/Cencosud-X), as SRE of the Platform Team. I have more than 4 years of experience as **the devops guy**  and many more as a mukltipurpose geek, a lot like a sysadmin and before that. In the beggining of time, there was an species named webmasters, and I was one of them.

Besides, I'm promoting an initiative named **SREDevOps.dev**, where we seek the promotion and support for the SRE/DevOps culture, through communities and platforms,  mostly within Latin America, through activities involving sharing knowledge, tools, technologies, practices and labs.
